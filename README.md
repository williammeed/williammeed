<h2>Who I Am</h2>
<p>
I’m someone who genuinely enjoys solving problems and helping people get back on track when technology gets in the way. Friends and colleagues often come to me first when something breaks, not just because I can fix it, but because I explain things in a way that makes sense.  
</p>
<p>
I bring patience, curiosity, and a positive attitude to every challenge — whether that’s walking a non-technical user through a solution or troubleshooting stubborn systems in my home lab. I see every ticket not just as a problem, but as a chance to learn and make someone’s day easier.
